Tools for lazily tagging and cleaning up large collections of MP3 files 

My world view is that mp3 collections seem to be best organized by directories
like:
    <artist> - <album> (year, notes)/<track> - <title>.ext

I recognize a large number of other people, incl. iTunes (tm.) use:
    <artist>/<album>/<track> - <title>.ext 

This software is currently incompatible with the later viewpoint (since I have
no interest in developing/testing it), but if you want to contribute patches to
make both work, they are welcome.

Requirements:
    TagLib (1.5?)
    Python 2.5.x (2.4/2.3 may work but are untested)
